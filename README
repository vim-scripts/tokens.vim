This is fairly rough at the moment but what it does is allow tokens within abbreviations that you will be prompted to replace. These are based on the following digraphs:

<C-K>Cu    -  if you use this token you will be prompted at every occurence
                    
<C-K>MW  -  you will only be prompted once and every subsequent use
                        of this token will be the input you entered.

<C-K>TH    -  Place this where you'd like the cursor to end up.
                        This is a bit buggy at the moment so any comments  
                         are welcomed.

<C-K><< and >>  -  If you want to provide a message as to what you're
                                  replacing use these. The only stipulation is that the 
                                  message be exactly 15 chars including << and >>

<C-K>',    -   Because this plugin uses liblist.vim, commas need to be 
                     entered using this digraph.

The mapping used is <leader>et

Reading the script probably explains things better than I'm doing here but here's a few egs. (These are all insert mode by the way)
Eg1
     type   dic
     hit <leader>et
     you'll see the prompt  <<   class name  >>
     type in foo and hit <CR>
     the string   <div class="foo">|</div>   will be inserted with the cursor at the pipe.
(this uses the 'Cu','<<>>' and 'TH' digraphs)
Eg2
     type hd
     hit <leader>et
     you'll see the prompt  <<header level?>>
     type in 2 and hit <CR>
     the string <h2>|</h2> will be inserted again with the cursor at the pipe
(this uses the 'MW','<<>>' and 'TH' digraphs)    

Known issues:
    For some reason you can't place the 'TH' digraph at the end of the string. It  executes once OK but then stops.


As I'm not a programmer this could more than likely do with a complete overhaul. If anybody would like to help out or make suggestions, email markwoodwardATbigpond.com. I'd appreciate some input as I think the ideas pretty impressive but my executions not ;-)
